Use MongoDB Atlas [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (or Cloud Development Kit) constructs to manage [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). The AWS CDK is a framework for defining infrastructure as code (IaC). It allows developers to write code in their preferred programming language, such as TypeScript for example, to define and deploy infrastructure. AWS CDK gets synthesized down into [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates at deployment so users no longer have to write or maintain YAML/JSON based CloudFormation templates.

## Available Constructors
MongoDB Atlas AWS CDK Resources provides L1, L2 and L3 CDK constructors. Please, have a look at [README.md](src/README.md#cdk-constructors) for a full lists of constructors and examples.
## Getting Started
See the [cdk examples](examples/README.md) for how to setup prerequisites & get started with your first cluster, using our AWS CDK sample code. We also provide a quick guide on [How to Deploy MongoDB Atlas with AWS CDK in TypeScript](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/deploy-mongodb-atlas-aws-cdk-typescript/).

## Support, Bugs, Feature Requests
Feature requests can be submitted at [feedback.mongodb.com](https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924145-atlas/category/392596-atlas-cloudformation-resources) - just select "Atlas CloudFormation Resources" as the category or vote for an already suggested feature.

Support for the MongoDB Atlas Resource Provider for CloudFormation is provided under MongoDB Atlas support plans, starting with Developer. Please submit support questions within the Atlas UI. In addition, support questions submitted under the Issues section of this repo are also being monitored. Bugs should be filed under the Issues section of this repo.

## MongoDB Atlas API Keys Credential Management
Atlas API keys Configuration are required for both CloudFormation and CDK resources, and this Atlas API key pair are provided as input by the use of a Profile.

AWS CloudFormation limits Third Parties from using non-AWS API Keys as either hardcoded secrets in CloudFormation templates or via CDK, hence we now require all the users store MongoDB Atlas API Keys via [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

`NOTE: the process for configuring the PROFILE is the same and is required both for CloudFormation and CDK`

### 1. Configure your MongoDB Atlas API Keys
You'll need to generate an API key pair (public and private keys) for your Atlas organization and configure them to grant CloudFormation access to your Atlas project.
Refer to the [Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/#manage-programmatic-access-to-an-organization) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Configure your Profile
To use Atlas CloudFormation resources, you must configure a "profile" with your API keys using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

The secret should follow this format:
```
SecretName: cfn/atlas/profile/{ProfileName}
SecretValue: {"PublicKey": "YourPublicKey", "PrivateKey": "YourPrivateKey"}
```

To create a new secret for a default profile, use the [PROFILE SECRET TEMPLATE](/examples/profile-secret.yaml) file provided in this repository.

Here are some examples of how to use this template:

#### example 1:
```
ProfileName: default
SecretName: cfn/atlas/profile/default
SecretValue: {"PublicKey": "YourPublicKey", "PrivateKey": "YourPrivateKey"}
```
#### example 2:
```
ProfileName: testProfile
SecretName: cfn/atlas/profile/testProfile
SecretValue: {"PublicKey": "YourPublicKey", "PrivateKey": "YourPrivateKey"}
```

## Issues

### Autoclose stale issues and PRs
- After 5 days of no activity (no comments or commits on an issue/PR) we automatically tag it as "stale" and add a message: ```This issue/PR has gone 5 days without any activity and meets the project's definition of "stale". This will be auto-closed if there is no new activity over the next 5 days. If the issue is still relevant and active, you can simply comment with a "bump" to keep it open, or add the label "not_stale". Thanks for keeping our repository healthy!```
- After 5 more days of no activity we automatically close the issue/PR.

### One-click reproducible issues principle
Our support will prioritise issues that contain all the required information that follows the following principles:

* We should be able to make no changes to your provided script and **successfully run a local execution reproducing the issue**.
  * This means that you should kindly **provide all the required instructions**. This includes but not limited to:
    * AWS CDK package version used to reproduce the issue
    * CFN resource version and AWS region used to reproduce the issue
  * Issues that **cannot be properly reproduced will be de-prioritised** in favour of the ones that succeed.
* Before opening an issue, you have to try to specifically isolate it to the **CDK MongoDB Atlas constructor** by **removing as many dependencies** as possible. If the issue only happens with other dependencies, then:
  * If other CDK constructors are required, please make sure you also include those. _Same "one-click reproducible issue" principle applies_.
  * If external components are required to replicate it, please make sure you also provides instructions on those parts.
