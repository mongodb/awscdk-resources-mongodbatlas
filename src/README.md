## L1 Constructors
L1 constructs are called Cfn (short for CloudFormation) resources. These resources are periodically generated from a specification called AWS CloudFormation Resource Specification and follow a naming pattern of "CfnXyz" where "Xyz" is the name of the resource. When working with Cfn resources, it is necessary to configure all of their properties, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying CloudFormation resource model and its attributes. This means that a high level of technical expertise and knowledge is needed to effectively work with Cfn resources.

To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Project Atlas Admin role. This resource doesn't require the API Key to have an Access List.  To get MongoDB Cloud to generate a managed certificate for a database user, set  ` "x509Type" : "MANAGED" `  on the desired MongoDB Database User.  If you are managing your own Certificate Authority (CA) in Self-Managed X.509 mode, you must generate certificates for database users using your own CA. | [README.md](l1-resources/x509-authentication-database-user/README.md) |                                                                                                                                                                                                    



## L2 Constructors
L2 constructs represent AWS resources with a higher-level, intent-based API. They provide additional functionality with defaults, boilerplate, and glue logic that you’d be writing yourself with L1 constructs. AWS constructs offer convenient defaults and reduce the need to know all of the details about the AWS resources that they represent. This is done while providing convenient methods that make it simpler to work with the resources and as a result create your application. See [AWS DevOps Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/leverage-l2-constructs-to-reduce-the-complexity-of-your-aws-cdk-application/).

## L3 Constructors
L3 constructs are called patterns. They’re designed to complete common tasks in MongoDB Atlas and AWS , often involving multiple types of resources. See [AWS DevOps Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/leverage-l2-constructs-to-reduce-the-complexity-of-your-aws-cdk-application/).
