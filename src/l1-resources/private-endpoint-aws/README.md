## Description

Creates one private endpoint for the specified cloud service provider. This cloud service provider manages the private endpoint service, which in turn manages the private endpoints for the project.

To learn more about considerations, limitations, and prerequisites, see the MongoDB documentation for setting up a private endpoint.
